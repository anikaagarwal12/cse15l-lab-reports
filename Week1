This a command that changes the working directory. When we have no arguments passed in, the working directory was changed to the home directory. With a directory argument, the new working directory was changed to the directory passed as an argument. When a file path was passed in as an arguemment, an error message was thrown saying that the file wasn't a directory. The cd command can only accept directory arguments as that's what's going to be the final directory.
