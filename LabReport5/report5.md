```
Hello,

My name is Anika Agarwal and I am having this issue in my code somewhere in this project.
Here is what I see on my end when I try to run `bash test.sh`.

Here is my code that I have written. I think the error is related my to th length of my arraylist. Each time I call merge(), I create a new arraylist. It seems like I am adding more elements to the arrayList than there is space for which is why I am getting an IndexOutOfBoundsException. Should I throw an exception in my method to limit the number of elements that I can add?

Thank you so much for your help!

Best Regards,
Anika Agarwal
